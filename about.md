I am Amir; 

I was born in Iran in there year that George Orwell used for this famouse last title and on the day that people enjoy smoking the most ritual herbs of it all. If you 
get it you'll never forget. 

I did solid-state physics for my undergraduate, some crystal growth for my master's, optics, 
scientific instrumentation, programming, image processing, chemistry, electronics, and hardware design for my PhD! 
If this doesn't impress you then I have to say I am doing neuroscience now as my frist postdoctural reseach project. BOOM!
I loved what I did and I love what do. 

As part of my personal life, I do some indoor gardening, some looping with my eGuitar in ableton, running, cycling and squash. 
I got hooked on cycling for the last 4 years and it kind of filled my weekend days. Squash gave me great chance to meet very
intersting people to improve my skill in Taiwan. I only played as hobby-like thing back in Iran. 

I got here, if here is somewhere, through help and support of known and unkown manies. I would like to 
share my minute contribution, modification or composition for what I have learnt from others and THE internet.

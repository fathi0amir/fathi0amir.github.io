title: 3D Models
---

[This repository](https://github.com/fathi0amir/3D-Models) is dedicated to all my home-brewed very experimental and functional 3D models. Feel free to use
them how you see fit. 

- The alignment tools were 3D printed for different thread standards to help me with the Nikon inverted microscope 
vertical beam alignment. 

- The AOM adapter was designed to interface Gooch and Housego AOM with a generic 
thorlab rotational stage.

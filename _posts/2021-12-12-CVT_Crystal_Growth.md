title: Crystal Growth by Chemical Vapor Transport Technique (CVT)
---

During my master degree I managed to grow some ZnSSe crystals by CVT technique. To do that I had 
to find the right calibration curve for the temperature difference inside the tube-furnace. To do 
so I had to calculate the pressure of the possible species in the vaccum tube using the chernove 
bulk diffusion model.

I did this project a very long time ago. I just tried to pull together a MatLab code 
that used and a short disctription of the technique. I also uploaded all my other codes and 
conditions in a zip file. There are a poster and paper but unfortunately they are only 
in persian. 

The files are available in [this](https://github.com/fathi0amir/ZnSSe_CVT) repository. 

Hope it come handy somehow for someone!

title: Reference Ciruite desing for a Sine Wave to Square Wave converter and DC Level Shitfter

![DC Level Shifter and Sine to TTL converter]((https://github.com/fathi0amir/DC_Shifter-Sine2TTL/blob/main/THS3202EVM_Sine2TTL.png?raw=true)
In my past experiment I had to build a circuit to convert -1 to 1 sine wave to 0 to 1 sqare wave. It 
was mostly due to saving cost and better inegration with the lock-in amplifier. I Used the THS3202EVM 
board which is a evaluation board for the high-speed current amplifier. The simulation file in NI Multisim 
format can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/fathi0amir/DC_Shifter-Sine2TTL)

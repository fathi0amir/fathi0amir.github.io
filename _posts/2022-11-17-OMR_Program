title: A Simple OMR Study Program (for Zebrafish)
---

For my experiment I was set to make program that can 
trigger swimming behaviour in an head-fixed adult zebrafish. 
This kind of behaviour can be triggered by presenting a 
moving grating. To do so I made simple animation for 
different kind of moving grating that can trigger the 
swimming in upward, downward, left, right, forward and backward
direction in Blender. The with a simple labview program 
I can read the frames and have control over the frame-rate. 

This simple setup can be expanded for recording various data 
which in my case was recording swimming direction with a help 
of a torque and force sensor (this acquisition part is not included). 

Hopefully this simple program can be helpful to researchers around the world.

all the movies along with the blender files.

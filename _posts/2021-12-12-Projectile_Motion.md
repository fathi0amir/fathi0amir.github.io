title: Projectile Motion with Drag Force in Mathematica
---
As far as I rememeber this is my frist fully accomplished project. 
I had to calculate and compare a projectile's motion without and with the 
air resistance (drag force). I basically keep this here for my own personal pleasure as a thing to remember.
If you evaluate the "Projectile-Comparison.nb"  in [this](https://github.com/fathi0amir/Projectile_Motion) 
repository you should be able to get something like below

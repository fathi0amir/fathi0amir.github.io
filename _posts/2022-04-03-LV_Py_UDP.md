title: UDP Sender/Receiver between LabVIEW and Python
---

I have been developing and imaging system that can monitor the brain activity 
at cellular level in a transgenic adult zebrafish brain. The imaging is done 
while the animal is swimming in an immersive virtual reality environment. 
The animal is head-fixed and forces are recoded with a load cell. With the 
sensors data I could get necessary metric to navigate in a 3D rendering 
environment. In our case, we used Panda3D which can be scripted in Python. The main 
challenge was how to send the meterics recorded in LabVIEW to the Python 
script. There are several ways to that, such as, Python node VI in LabVIEW, 
ActivX object, TCP and UDP. I chose UDP as I need fast (less than 10 ms) 
communication. ActiveX and Python node VI were not fast enough for my 
application. Although UDP is a lossy protocol, it is still suitable for my application.

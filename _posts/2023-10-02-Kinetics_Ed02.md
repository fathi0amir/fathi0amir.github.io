I have added an updated Mathematica file [here](https://github.com/fathi0amir/Kinetics)
named as "DecayModelling.nb" that has more details on how to drive the model from
a set of differential equations and initial conditions. Additionally, it has
all the analytical solution at the end with thoughtfully organized modules.
The modules can be mixed and matched to build several models.

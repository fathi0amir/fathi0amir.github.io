title: Building Wrapper Library to use PICam SDK in LabVIEW

![PICam-LabVIEW-Wrapper](https://github.com/fathi0amir/fathi0amir.github.io/blob/master/images/config.png?raw=true)
[This project](https://github.com/fathi0amir/Kinetics) is a simple C++ wrapper for the PICam SDK. The purpose of this wrapper is to resolve necessary pointers, perform data conversions, and expose certain functions to LabVIEW. The wrapper is designed to be used in LabVIEW as a DLL. The wrapper is not a complete wrapper for the PICam SDK, but it does provide a good starting point for developing a more complete wrapper.

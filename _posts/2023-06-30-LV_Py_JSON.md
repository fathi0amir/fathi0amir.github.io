title: Fast Bidirectional Data Communication Between LabVIEW and Python
---

I have put together a demo project that passes JSON object between LabVIEW and Python over 
UDP socket. There are several advantages here compare to my [previous demo](https://fathi0amir.github.io/LV_Py_UDP/).  
![LabVIEW Python JSON Over UDP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fathi0amir/LabVIEW-Python-JSON-UDP/main/LabVIEW_Python_JSON.png)

Passing JSON object allows for serializing and deserializing natively in python and LabVIEW. The Data 
can be labeled and fetched on the other end by calling the label. Any data type can be passed in 
one object. This is simple demo that shows sending and receiving a double array, integer, boolean and string between 
LabVIEW and Python. The code snippet from both ends is shown above. To run this code you just need to 
run the LabVIEW code. The Python console will open and shows the recieved data on python side. 
It is done with running the python code by calling the windows commandline from inside 
LabVIEW.

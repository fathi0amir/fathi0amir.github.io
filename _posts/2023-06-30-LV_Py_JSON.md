title: Fast Bidirectional Data Communication Between LabVIEW and Python
---

I have put together a demo project that passes JSON object between LabVIEW and Python over 
UDP socket. There are several advantages here compare to my [previous demo](https://fathi0amir.github.io/LV_Py_UDP/).
Passing JSON object allows for serializing and deserializing natively in python and LabVIEW. The Data 
can be labeled and fetched on the other end by calling the label. Any data type can be passed in 
one object. This is simple demo that shows sending and receiving a double array, integer, boolean and string between 
LabVIEW and Python. The code snippet from both ends is shown below.

title: Series of Macros for Repetitive Image Processing
---
My project typically involved extracting features from a time-resolved images. I was trying to get meaningfull metrics to 
compare mophological features and lifetime values accross the stack of images. To ease my pain I tried to automate as many 
operations as can. It all ended up with bunch of imagej macros that I am shairing [here](https://github.com/fathi0amir/TAM_SEM_ImageJ_Macros) for others as a reference to get some ideas 
in case of doing something similar.

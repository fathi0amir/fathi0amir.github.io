title: Multi-component Exponential Fitting algorithms in MatLab
---

Coming soon ... 
I will update this page with all the codes I have written in MatLab to process multi-exponential decays. The instrument response function (IRF) can be
synthsized or acquried then be numerically convoluted with the model for precise lifetime calculation. Alternatively, the model can be 
evaluated with the IRF in mind. Hopefully they can serve as an starting point or a reference for various applications.

title: Optical/Chemical Kinetics
---

[This is](https://github.com/fathi0amir/Kinetics) a Mathematica file 
that evaluates a series of different kinetics from 
their differtial equation form. Depending on whether doing chemistry or 
photochemistry this can find the concentration of products or the excitons 
respectively. The conditions are a typical summation of exponential decays, to 
profiles with a rise feature or a conditions that the decay is proceeded after 
a spike (rise = decay time-constant).

I think it is a bit messy but I hope I get some spare time to organize this and 
comments even more thoroughly. Meanwhile I hope it can be of any assitance or help.

title: Tuned Amplifier (Replace Lockin with a simple circuit)
---

During my PhD program there were some concerns about the long time constant of the lock-in amplifer (SRS-844) which caused 
directional bluring (along the fast axis) in our laser scanning microscope. Knowing the fact that lock-in amplifers are 
costly I got the motivation to simulate and build an analogue circuit to overcome this. I was aware of a paper that discussed 
a module (tuned amplifier) to replace a lock to detect estmulated Raman scattering (SRS) signal. I basically replated their work 
which was also originated from a paper from 1992. Here I attach my design as a reference in case anyone wants to implement it in 
therir system. In my case I got a funding source to buy a faster lock-in amplifier so I did not pursue this further.
